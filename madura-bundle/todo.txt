Should we simplify the tests by building bundles outside the madura-bundle project? We'd have to copy the jars around so maybe not.

What, if anything, should this stuff handle/use CDI or service loader?
Difficult to see how to inject configuration into either of those. eg how to specify the bundles dir?

We could, therefore, configure a CDI container application that defines a bundle manager. But the proxying stuff is very Spring.

It would need to be a very different looking animal. So no.

Create new repo and load the stuff into it.
