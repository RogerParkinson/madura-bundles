madura-bundles
==============

Updated version of MaduraBundles: restructured the project and added maven

Provides a structured way to dynamically add jar files to your classpath. The jar files can come
from a sweep directory or from maven.

The container application can inject Spring beans from the jar files (using proxies) in a way that is largely transparent from the calling application.
